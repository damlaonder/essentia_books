# essentia_books
Essentia is a collaborative project that I started working on within a competitive Tech Cohort (Tech Treks) at NYU. 

Our goal is to create a platform in which users can log their favorite books and music. From there, it will generate music recommendations based on their favorite books and vice versa. 
We are using python, html/css, figma, bootstrap, postgres psql, and flask to design, code, and create this project. 

This project was inspired by bringing together art and technology. We decided to call it Essentia because 'essentia' means essence, substance, being, existing entity, whole.
Our favorite books and music are parts of us - they are tools that we use to feel our emotions, to learn about ourselves and the world, and to capture our souls into something 
we understand... hence essentia. 

Here are some of the steps in our progress so far:

After successfully creating our platform on small amounts of personal data, we hope to take it to the next step by using Cassandra and mass amounts of data.
